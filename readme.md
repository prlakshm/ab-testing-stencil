You will use this repo to complete cs1300's ab testing assignment! 

This is a public template, so, INSTEAD OF FORKING (!), please use "use this template" button (on the top right of the repo's homepage) to copy your own version of this repo into your github account to build off of this stencil.

This contains two pages that are identical: a.html & b.html. You are tasked with modifying b.html (along with appointements-b.css) to impact how the user may finish the provided task.

This repo contains the javascript that will store and download the user's data while using both versions of the site. DO NOT MODIFY the provided javascript files (unless you know what you are doing); if you need to add javascript to accomodate your changes to b.html, make a new file!

From the uiux tas, we hope you enjoy the assignment :)
